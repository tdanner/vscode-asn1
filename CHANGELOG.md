# Changelog

The authoritative release notes live in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tdanner/vscode-asn1/releases).

During tagged CI builds the workflow rewrites this file with the aggregated release
history so the VSIX published to the Marketplace carries the same notes. Developers
making a new release should update the notes in GitHubâ€”no manual edits to this file
are required.
